I'm a PhD-student in economics at the Department of Economics at University of Southern Denmark
During my PhD, I spent the academic fall 2022 at the Stanford Univeristy.
I'm part of the Econometrics and Data Science research platform and affiliated with the Historical Economics and Development Group (HEDG).

## My research
My research focuses on causal inference and data science, and in particular on using methods from machine learning to answer questions regarding the importance of early life conditions and policy evaluation. 
In my research, I use machine learning for data creation from historical documents and causal machine learning. 
My current projects include research within the development of new methods for data creation and empirical analyses of health intervention programs.
