Course for the GMM engineering bachelors's program (5 ECTS).
The course cover introductionary statistics, including probability theory, confidence inetrvals, hypothesis testing, linear regression analysis, factor analysis, and cluster analysis.
The goal is to give students the ability to confidently perform and interpret statistical analyses.

I fully revised the course material following the re-introduction of the course (following a period where the course was not taught).
