Course for the Data Science master's program (10 ECTS).
The course covers support vector machines, random forests, boosting, and deep learning, with an emphasis on deep learning.
The goal is to give students the ability to confidently apply state-of-the-art machine learning methods to a broad class of problems, including computer vision and natural language processing.

I designed the course from scratch and was responsible for all aspects of the material covered and the exam.
